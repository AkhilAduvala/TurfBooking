# TurfBooking
This is a repository for the project Turf Booking Management System

Hey There,

So as informed this is a project to create a web/mobile application that allows the users to book the Turf(s) at the selected location. 
This system also provides the Turf Managers to view the available slots and confirmed bookings from the calendar,while the Admin would be able to manage turfs and locations. I have attached a detailed requirement document with the initial requirements, tech stack and design.

Thanks and Regards,
Akhil Aduvala
