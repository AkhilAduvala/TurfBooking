### Development Phase

1. **Local Development Environment**:
   - **Backend**: Focus on building your backend services using Spring Boot.
   - **Frontend**: Develop your frontend using Angular or the chosen framework.
   - **Database**: Use a local instance of Oracle DB or MySQL DB for development.
   - **Testing**: Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

2. **Local Testing**:
   - Test the integration of different components locally.
   - Ensure that all functionalities, such as booking, payment processing, and notifications, work correctly.

### Post-Development Phase

Once your application code is complete and tested locally, you can proceed with server configuration and deployment. This ensures that your development environment remains simple and focused on coding.

### Server Configuration and Deployment

1. **Set Up Servers**:
   - **Web Server**: Install and configure Nginx.
   - **Application Server**: Use the embedded Tomcat server provided by Spring Boot.

2. **Deployment Steps**:
   - **Package Your Application**:
     - Build your Spring Boot application into a deployable JAR or WAR file.
     ```sh
     mvn clean package
     ```

   - **Deploy to Servers**:
     - Deploy your packaged application to your production servers.
     - Configure Nginx to route traffic to your Spring Boot application.

3. **Security**:
   - **SSL/TLS**: Set up SSL/TLS to secure communication between clients and servers.
   - **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement Spring Security with OAuth2.0/JWT for secure authentication and authorization.

4. **Load Balancing and Scaling**:
   - Configure Nginx for load balancing if you have multiple instances of your application.
   - Set up auto-scaling groups if using a cloud provider like AWS to handle varying traffic loads.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Integrate Spring Boot Actuator for health checks and monitoring.
   - Set up centralized logging and monitoring tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or AWS CloudWatch.

### Example Deployment Workflow

1. **Build the Application**:
   - Ensure all code is committed to your version control system (e.g., GitHub).
   - Use CI/CD tools like Jenkins to automate the build process.

2. **Provision Infrastructure**:
   - Use infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to provision servers and other resources.

3. **Deploy the Application**:
   - Use deployment scripts or tools like Ansible to deploy your application to the provisioned servers.

4. **Configure Nginx**:
   - Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy to forward requests to your Spring Boot application.
   - Configure SSL/TLS for secure communication.

5. **Set Up Monitoring**:
   - Enable Spring Boot Actuator endpoints for monitoring.
   - Integrate with monitoring tools to keep track of application health and performance.

### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Implementing CI/CD pipelines can significantly streamline your deployment process:

1. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Automatically build and test your application whenever changes are committed.
   - Use tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.

2. **Continuous Deployment**:
   - Automatically deploy tested code to staging or production environments.
   - Use deployment tools like Ansible, Terraform, or cloud-native solutions like AWS CodeDeploy.

### Conclusion

By focusing on code development first and handling server configuration and deployment afterward, you can maintain a clear separation of concerns and streamline your development workflow. This approach allows you to:

- **Develop and Test Locally**: Ensure your application works correctly before deploying it.
- **Automate Deployment**: Use CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
- **Configure Production Environment**: Set up and configure servers for production, ensuring security, scalability, and monitoring.

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Code Development**: Finish writing and testing your application code.
2. **Set Up CI/CD Pipelines**: Implement automated build and deployment processes.
3. **Configure Servers and Deploy**: Set up Nginx, deploy your application, and configure SSL/TLS, load balancing, and monitoring.
4. **Monitor and Maintain**: Continuously monitor your application and infrastructure, and make adjustments as needed.
